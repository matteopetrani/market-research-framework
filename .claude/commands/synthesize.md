# Synthesize Command

Aggregate research findings into actionable executive summary with viability assessment and MVP recommendations.

## Usage

`/synthesize $ARGUMENTS`

## Output and Evidence Standards

- Tie every recommendation to evidence in `research/` files with citations.
- Use this citation format: `[Source Name](URL) - accessed YYYY-MM-DD`
- Include a "Known Unknowns" or "Gaps" section in the executive summary.
- Do not invent missing research or citations.

## File Handling

- Create `output/` if it does not exist.
- Do not overwrite existing files without confirming with the user.

## Modes

### Default (no arguments)
Create concise executive summary with key findings and MVP recommendations.

Use the `synthesizing-research` skill to read all files in `research/` folder and create `output/executive-summary.md` with:
- Market opportunity overview
- Competitive positioning
- User validation findings
- Key differentiators
- MVP feature recommendations
- Viability assessment (go/no-go framework)
- Risk factors and mitigations
- Next steps
- Known unknowns and gaps

### `detailed`
Create extended synthesis with multiple planning documents.

In addition to executive summary, generate:
- `output/mvp-feature-spec.md` - Prioritized MVP feature requirements with rationale
- `output/content-strategy.md` - Content and editorial approach
- `output/validation-plan.md` - Experiments to test key assumptions
- `output/go-to-market.md` - Initial user acquisition strategy

## Prerequisites

Before running synthesis, ensure you have completed:
- **Minimum:** At least 2-3 `/research competitor <url>` analyses and `/research market`
- **Recommended:** `/research community` and `/research assumptions` (requires `assumptions.md` in project root)
- **Optional:** `/research hidden-competitors` for expanded competitive view

Note: If you have an `assumptions.md` file in the project root, the synthesis will incorporate assumption validation results.

## Instructions for Claude

When the user runs `/synthesize`:

1. Read `domain-config.md` from project root to understand product name, market context, and key differentiators
2. Verify that research files exist in the `research/` directory
3. If required files are missing, list them and stop (do not guess)
4. Check if `assumptions.md` exists in the project root and include it in synthesis if available
5. Use the `synthesizing-research` skill to read and aggregate all research findings
6. Extract cross-cutting insights and identify key themes
7. Create viability assessment based on evidence from research with citations
8. Generate actionable MVP recommendations with strategic rationale and citations
9. Include a "Known Unknowns" or "Gaps" section
10. For `detailed` mode, create additional planning documents
11. Provide brief summary of key findings and viability conclusion
12. Suggest next steps based on the viability assessment

Note: Synthesis will overwrite existing files in `output/` directory. Confirm with the user before overwriting.
